Web Form Project
Description

This project is a four-page web application built with HTML5 and Bootstrap 5.3 that includes an index (welcome) page, a form page, a confirmation page, and a thank-you page. The purpose of this project is to design and implement a responsive, accessible, and user-friendly web form that follows best practices in structure, styling, and validation.

Best Practices for Web Forms

Throughout the design and development of this project, I followed several web form best practices to ensure usability and clarity. The form uses clear and descriptive labels for each input field, which helps users understand what information is required. Each label is explicitly connected to its corresponding input element using the for attribute, ensuring both proper structure and accessibility. Required fields are clearly indicated to guide users through completion, and form validation prevents incomplete or incorrectly formatted submissions.

Another best practice implemented is maintaining logical grouping and alignment of form elements. Related inputs are organized together using <fieldset> and <legend> tags where appropriate. Buttons and input fields are styled consistently with Bootstrap, ensuring that the form looks professional and is easy to navigate on different devices. A confirmation page allows users to review their information before submitting, which helps reduce user error — an important usability feature.

Finally, the form provides helpful feedback and uses concise placeholder text to illustrate the expected input format without overwhelming the user. A Font Awesome icon is included as a tooltip prompt to offer additional context or instructions, improving user confidence and reducing confusion.

Accessibility Features

Accessibility was a key focus in the design of this project. The form includes aria-label attributes and semantic HTML elements to ensure screen readers can interpret the content correctly. All text has sufficient contrast for readability, and form controls are keyboard-navigable. Error messages and validation prompts are communicated in a clear, descriptive way to assist users with different abilities. In addition, the layout adapts to different screen sizes using Bootstrap’s responsive grid system, ensuring that users on desktop, tablet, or mobile devices can complete the form without difficulty.
